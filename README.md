# Recipe Search Made Easy

This Recipe Search application is designed so that anyone can use it to look up a recipe and create a meal from what they already have at home. We all need to eat so that we can function and grow on a day to day basis so this app can work for anyone. The UI is designed so that the user can create a routine and maintain health habits. YouTube videos are also displayed for additional user experience. Our motivation for this app is to allow for a healthy lifestyle. Future development will include meal preparation and a calorie counter to allow the user to fine tune their healthy lifestyle. This app is driven with JavaScript and Bulma, and has two api keys from Edimam and YouTube.
